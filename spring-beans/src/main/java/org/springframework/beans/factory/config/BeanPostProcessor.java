/**
 * Factory hook that allows for custom modification of new bean instances &mdash;
 * for example, checking for marker interfaces or wrapping beans with proxies.
 *
 * <p>Typically, post-processors that populate beans via marker interfaces
 * or the like will implement {@link #postProcessBeforeInitialization},
 * while post-processors that wrap beans with proxies will normally
 * implement {@link #postProcessAfterInitialization}.
 *
 * <h3>Registration</h3>
 * <p>An {@code ApplicationContext} can autodetect {@code BeanPostProcessor} beans
 * in its bean definitions and apply those post-processors to any beans subsequently
 * created. A plain {@code BeanFactory} allows for programmatic registration of
 * post-processors, applying them to all beans created through the bean factory.
 *
 * <h3>Ordering</h3>
 * <p>{@code BeanPostProcessor} beans that are autodetected in an
 * {@code ApplicationContext} will be ordered according to
 * {@link org.springframework.core.PriorityOrdered} and
 * {@link org.springframework.core.Ordered} semantics. In contrast,
 * {@code BeanPostProcessor} beans that are registered programmatically with a
 * {@code BeanFactory} will be applied in the order of registration; any ordering
 * semantics expressed through implementing the
 * {@code PriorityOrdered} or {@code Ordered} interface will be ignored for
 * programmatically registered post-processors. Furthermore, the
 * {@link org.springframework.core.annotation.Order @Order} annotation is not
 * taken into account for {@code BeanPostProcessor} beans.
